Mojo Facets - server side facet browsing using Mojolicious and jQuery UI


Data sources:

Put JSON file from Simile Exhibit project in data/ with extension .js or .json

Alternative format is pipe (|) separated text files with extension .txt
First column is always header with field names
Multi-line values should be wrapped in ^multi-line-text^

If you save bounch of html files with table in directory with .html extension, they will
we all read as single data set, allowing easy analysys of search results, for example.


Start with:

    LANG=hr_HR.utf8 ./script/mojo_facets daemon --reload


Data action and changes:

There are two kinds of audit log in MojoFacets:

1. actions stored in /tmp/actions are clicks on user interface with parameters,
   they will probably be erased on next reboot since they are in /tmp

2. changes in data/database.changes are more structured, including old value
   and unique identifiers for that row

Changes can be applied on any dataset currently in memory.

Whole idea of changes is to create audit log which is detailed enough to recostruct
current state of dataset from source file and list of changes. However, to speed
up operations, you can periodically save your in-memory data to /tmp/ in perl
storeable format using save link in interface.


Data replication:

Actions can be replicated to other hosts using MASTER enviroment variable
or config menu

    # slave
    MASTER=http://localhost:4444 ./script/mojo_facets daemon --reload


Code console to modify data using perl snippets:

Experimental REPL console supports perl snippets which get $row hash which is one
element from your dataset.

If you want to create or update values, you will have to use $update hash to set
new values.

All values are repetable, but if you create just a scalar, magic(tm) inside MojoFacets
will try to upgrade it to [ $scalar ] so you don't have to do it explicitly.

Code examples are stored in public/code

They use column1,column2.description.pl notatition so only snippets which have applicable
column will be shown.


Export data:

All exported data is stored in public/export/database/

There you can find saved filters and items generated with export checkbox

    filter.column_name.optional_description
	items.column1.column2.column3
